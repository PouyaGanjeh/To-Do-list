Our daily tasks are divided into four categories: important and urgent, important and non-urgent, urgent and unimportant, and unimportant and non-urgent. 
The goal of this program is to integrate these categories into one view, allowing for convenience in using the software and accurate planning.
The program is being developed using Python, Django framework, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML programming languages. 
A key feature of this program is displaying the date of status changes, providing clarity for tasks with deadlines.
